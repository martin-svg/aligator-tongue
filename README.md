Docker Compose
# Resource : https://docs.docker.com/compose/
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

Step 1.0 - Create a docker-compose.yml file, that that file define two services - "web" and "db". 
The "web" service will use the Dockerfile for Apache/PHP container
The "db" service will use the Dockerfile for the MySQL container
